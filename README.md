# Effect of Telecommunication Infrastructure on COVID-19 in Brazil

This project aims to measure the impact of access to information, which is interpreted as the population’s access to telecommunications infrastructure, on the number of COVID-19 deaths per capita in different Brazilian municipalities. This infrastructure is measured through the number of per capita accesses to fixed and mobile broadband, cable television, and fixed telephony.

This study was conducted by José Barretto and Lucas Miguel Agrizzi as part of the final project of the course Project in Applied Economics (MODS207) at Télécom Paris, under the guidance of professor Ulrich Laitenberger.
